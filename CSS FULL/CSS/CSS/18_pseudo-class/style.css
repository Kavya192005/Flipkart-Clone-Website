/** Important Notes
/** ---------------------------------------- --> */
/* The :last-child pseudo-class selects an element if it's the last child within its parent element. It doesn't work if there are other elements after it within the same parent. */

/*? after last of type child let them know about first child too   */

/* The :first-child pseudo-class works similarly to :last-child, but it selects the first child element within its parent. Just like :last-child, it will only select an element if it's the first child and not if there are other elements before it within the same parent. */
