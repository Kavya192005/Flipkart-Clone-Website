    Void Elements / Empty Elements

    -> not all parts of web page use the causal pattern of having an opening tag,
    some content and then a closing tag. Some parts only need a single tag to work.
    These  are called "Void elements" or "Empty elements"
    
    -->

    <!-- source set -->

    <!-- <img 
    src="./assets/Image1.jpg" 
    alt="responsive image" 
    
    srcset="
    ./assets/Image1.webp 400w,
    ./assets/Image1.png 600w,
    "

    width="400"> -->

    <!-- Picture tag -->

    <!-- The <picture> HTML elements contains zero or more 
        <Source> elements and one <img>
        element to offer alternative versions of an image  
        for different display/devices scenarios
     -->

     <!-- <picture>
        <source srcset="./assets/Image1.png" type="image/png">
        <source srcset="./assets/Image1.webp" type="image/webp ">
        <img src="./assets/Imasge1.jpg" alt="home image" width="400">

        optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element 
    -->

                <img src="./assets/Image1.png" alt="this alternative text" width="400">

    <!--*  IMPORTANT NOTE ON HTML FIGURE TAG  
    <!-- *---------------------------------------- -->
    <!--
    ? 1: The figure element is particularly useful for images,
     illustrations, diagrams, videos, audio clips, and other types of media. 

    ? 2: Use the alt attribute for images within the figure element to provide alternative text for accessibility. 

    ? 3: The figure element helps improve accessibility
     and search engine optimization by indicating the 
     content and its context.

    <!--* INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: HTML IMAGE TAG  
    <!-- *---------------------------------------- -->

    <!--? 1: How would you make an image responsive using 
    the width attribute? -->
    <!-- You can set the width attribute to a percentage value (e.g., width="100%") to make the image adjust its width based on the available space. -->

    <!--? 2: How do you create an image link using the <img> tag? -->
    <!-- You wrap the <img> tag with an anchor <a> tag and provide the href attribute in the <a> tag. -->

    <!--? 3: What's the difference between relative and absolute URLs 
    in the href attribute? -->
    <!-- Relative URLs are URLs that are relative 
     to the current page's URL. Absolute
    URLs are complete URLs, including the protocol (http/https) and domain. -->

    <!--? 4: Why is providing descriptive alt text for images important? It improves -->
    <!-- accessibility for users with visual impairments and helps search engines 
    understand image content.
